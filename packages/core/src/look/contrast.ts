/**
 * SOTE — Kontrast, gerechnet.
 *
 * **Kopiert aus SONE** (`core/src/doc/contrast.ts`, ADR-0135), und der Grund,
 * es zu kopieren, steht im Original: die Regel war da und wurde nicht
 * gehalten. In SOTE stand sie nicht einmal — meine Umkehrtöne und die Palette
 * sind von Hand gewählt und nie gemessen worden, und die Tests, die ich dafür
 * hatte, zählten Tokennamen. SONEs Satz aus ADR-0131 trifft es: „Two lists
 * agreeing with each other is not a check."
 *
 * Der Kommentar von dort gilt unverändert:
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ADR-0023 wrote the rule and never held it:
 *
 * > Contrast. Computed, not believed, and kept as a test.
 *
 * Believed is what it was. The evidence is in the stylesheet, beside
 * `--ink-500`:
 *
 * > Secondary text in the light theme used --ink-400, which is 3.6:1 on white
 * > and 3.3:1 on the sunken surface — under AA, on every quiet label in the
 * > interface.
 *
 * Somebody worked those numbers out by hand, once, wrote them in a comment and
 * moved on. Nothing recomputes them, so the next value chosen by eye is the
 * same mistake with nobody to notice — and a theme is a *space* of values, not
 * one: a workspace sets a tint, an accent and eight palette colours, and every
 * combination of those is a pairing somebody has to read.
 *
 * This module is the arithmetic. The test that uses it walks that space.
 *
 * ## Two colour operations, and they are not the same one
 *
 * **Luminance is not linear in sRGB.** The channel values have to be
 * linearised before they are weighted, which is why `contrastRatio` cannot be
 * done on the hex digits.
 *
 * **`color-mix(in srgb, …)` is linear in sRGB**, on exactly those hex digits,
 * with no linearisation at all. Mixing in the linear-light space would be a
 * different colour, and the stylesheet's surfaces are mixed by the browser in
 * `srgb` — so `mixSrgb` has to match what the browser does rather than what
 * the luminance formula does.

 * The same colour, moved only as far as it must be to be read on this ground.

 * **An accent has two jobs.** It fills a button, where `readableOn` computes the
 * text that goes on top of it; and it *is* text — a link, an active icon — on
 * one of the page's own surfaces, where nothing computed anything. One value
 * satisfies both only by luck, and a workspace picks that value out of a colour
 * input (ADR-0136).
 *
 * The direction is the ground's, not the colour's: on a light ground the only
 * way to gain contrast is down, and on a dark ground it is up. Down is a scale
 * of the channels, which keeps the hue exactly; up is a mix toward white, which
 * washes the hue out a little and is the operation that always terminates —
 * scaling up cannot move a colour whose channel is already at 255.
 *
 * A colour that already reads is returned untouched, which is the ordinary case:
 * a brand colour somebody chose to be visible usually is.
 *
 * ## The floor is a parameter, because a line is not a word (ADR-0137)
 *
 * `AA.text` is 4.5:1 and it is for text. A **line** — a focus ring, the border
 * of a focused field, the rule beside a selected item — is a control's boundary,
 * and the standard asks 3:1 of it. Deriving a border at the text floor darkens
 * it past what it needs and past the fill beside it, which shows as a ring; at
 * no floor at all, a pale accent is a focus ring at 1.07:1.

 * else — including mid grey itself — is a dark one, because that is the side
 * that needs the lighter thing drawn on it.
 *
 * Named because a second caller arrived: an instance may upload two marks, one
 * inked for light grounds and one for dark, and the rail decides which it gets
 * by its own colour. A copy of this line in the web package would be one rule
 * with two homes, and this repository has spent enough rounds on that shape.
 *
 * A colour, never a theme. A workspace may paint the rail with its accent
 * (ADR-0122), so a light instance can have the darkest surface on the screen —
