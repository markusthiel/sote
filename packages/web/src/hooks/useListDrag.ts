 *
 * SONE web — dragging rows in a flat list.
 *
 * The switcher's rows are a list somebody arranges (ADR-0031), and a list is not
 * a tree: there is no inside, no nesting boundary, and every row is a sibling of
 * every other. `useTreeDrag` answers a harder question and answers it with a
 * document-wide `[data-tree-row]` lookup, so reusing it in a panel that floats
 * over the sidebar would let the tree's rows become drop targets for a workspace.
 *
 * So this is a second consumer of `usePointerDrag` rather than a generalisation
 * of the tree's hook. The gesture — hold versus scroll, pointer capture,
 * swallowing the click that follows — is the shared part, and it is the part
 * every dragging bug in this project has been in.
 *
 * Rows are scoped to one container, and carry `data-list-row="<id>"`.
 */

/**
 * Where a drop would land: directly after `afterId`, or first when null.
 *
 * One field, not a row plus an intent. A flat list's gaps are the only
 * destinations, and naming a gap by the row above it means each gap has exactly
 * one name — the thing the tree had to normalise towards after drawing two lines
 * a few pixels apart for one gap.
