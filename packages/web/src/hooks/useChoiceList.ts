/**
 * SOTE web — aus SONE übernommen, unverändert.
 *
 * SONE web — a list that belongs to a field, and the keys that reach it
 * (ADR-0142).
 *
 * Six places put a list of choices under something somebody is typing into: the
 * person picker, the search panel's two fields, the tag field, and the `@` menu
 * in both a comment and the editor. **They had three different answers to the
 * same question, and four of them had none.**
 *
 * The answer that was already right is the slash menu's, written first and in
 * the other package:
 *
 * > the selected index has to live in one place or the keyboard and the list
 * > disagree about what is highlighted
 *
 * — and its renderer says the rest of it out loud: `role="listbox"`,
 * `role="option"`, `aria-selected`, `aria-activedescendant`, and the highlight
 * scrolled into view when the keyboard moves past the edge of the box.
 *
 * The slash menu keeps its index in plugin state, for a reason this hook cannot
 * improve on: `@sone/editor` must work without React (ADR-0016). So it stays as
 * it is, and this is the same shape for the six lists that *are* React's.
 *
 * ## What it does not own
 *
 * **Whether the list is open.** That is the caller's query, and every caller
 * decides it differently — two characters typed, an `@` under the caret, a
 * request that has come back. A hook that owned it would need to be told all
 * of that anyway.
 *
 * **What a key means when the list did not want it.** `handleKey` answers
 * *"was that mine?"* and nothing else. Enter with nothing highlighted still
 * submits the person picker's typed address (ADR-0119), still sends a comment,
 * and Escape still belongs to whoever knows what closing means here.
