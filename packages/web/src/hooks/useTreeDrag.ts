 *
 * ---
 *
 * SONE web — dragging entries in the tree.
 *
 * This replaces the HTML5 drag-and-drop it used to use. That never worked on
 * iOS — Safari does not fire those events — and I argued the picker was
 * sufficient there. It was not: the picker moves an entry *into* a folder and
 * cannot reorder, so the device this is mostly used from had no way to reorder
 * at all. "Other apps manage it" was the right answer.
 *
 * ## What is here, and what is not
 *
 * Only the tree's own rules: which row a point falls in, whether that means
 * before, inside or after it, and which of those are worth offering. The
 * gesture — hold versus scroll, when capture is taken, suppressing the click
 * that follows — lives in usePointerDrag, because the board needs it too and
 * every mistake this project has made in dragging was in that half.
 *
 * The row under the pointer is looked up with `elementFromPoint` rather than
 * listened for: during a captured pointer sequence every event is delivered to
 * the element that started it.
