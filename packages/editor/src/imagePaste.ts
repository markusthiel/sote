/**
 * SONE — pasting and dropping images.
 *
 * An image arrives as bytes and has to become a URL before it can be a block,
 * which means an upload — an asynchronous step in the middle of a synchronous
 * paste handler. Two consequences shape everything here:
 *
 *   1. A placeholder block is inserted immediately and filled in when the upload
 *      finishes. Without one, pasting a photo does nothing visible for several
 *      seconds and people paste again.
 *
 *   2. The placeholder is found again by block id, not by position. By the time
 *      the upload returns the document has moved: the person kept typing, or a
 *      collaborator edited above. A stored position would put the image
 *      somewhere else entirely — the same class of bug as the slash menu taking
 *      over the wrong block.
 *
 * The uploader is injected. This package must not know about HTTP endpoints
 * (ADR-0016), and injecting it also makes the failure paths testable.
