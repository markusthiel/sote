/**
 * SONE editor — locking a single block (ADR-0049).
 *
 * The case the page lock cannot serve: a page of working notes with one table of
 * figures that must not move.
 *
 * `locked: true` in a block's props, and one `filterTransaction` that refuses
 * any transaction whose steps touch a locked block. One place, for the reason
 * the page lock goes through `editable`: fifteen guarded commands are fifteen
 * chances for one to be forgotten, and the forgotten one is a hole nobody finds
 * until a locked block changes.
 *
 * A filter rather than read-only nodes, because ProseMirror has no per-node
 * editability. What it does have is the chance to reject a transaction before it
 * is applied, which is exactly the question being asked: would this change a
 * block somebody locked?
 *
 * Like the page lock, this is a guard and not a permission — anybody who may
 * edit the page may unlock the block.
