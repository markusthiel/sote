/**
 * SONE editor — naming somebody in the text (ADR-0085).
 *
 * The same shape as the slash menu, and deliberately so: a trigger character, a
 * query built from what follows it, and a plugin state the interface renders.
 * What differs is where the list comes from. Slash commands are a fixed
 * catalogue this package owns; the people in a workspace are not, so this
 * plugin holds a query and never a list — the interface fetches, filters and
 * draws, and calls `insertMention` when somebody is chosen.
 *
 * That division is the reason this is not simply the slash menu with a
 * different character. `@sone/editor` has no business knowing how this
 * application asks a server who is in a workspace, any more than it knows how
 * translations are stored.
 *
 * **The trigger is `@` at a word boundary.** An `@` in the middle of a word is
 * an email address, and offering to turn `markus@example.org` into a mention as
 * somebody types it would be worse than useless.
