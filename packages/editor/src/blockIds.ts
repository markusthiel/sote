/**
 * SONE — block id assignment.
 *
 * Every block needs a stable, globally unique id: `blocks.id` is a primary key
 * in the projection, and a duplicate is refused rather than silently
 * reassigned (ADR-0015). Two situations produce blocks without one, and both
 * happen constantly:
 *
 *   - typing Enter, which splits a block and copies its attributes including
 *     the id
 *   - pasting, whether from inside SONE or from another application
 *
 * So ids cannot be a schema default. This plugin runs after every transaction
 * and assigns one to any block that lacks it or that shares it with a block
 * seen earlier in the document.
 *
 * The "seen earlier" rule is what makes Enter work: the split leaves two nodes
 * with the same id, the first keeps it, and the second gets a fresh one. Which
 * of the two keeps the original is arbitrary but must be consistent — document
 * order is the only ordering available, so the earlier one wins.
