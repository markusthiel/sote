/**
 * SOTE — Platzhalter in leeren Blöcken. Aus SONE, Beschriftungen auf Deutsch:
 * SOTE spricht eine Sprache, und der erste Satz ist der, der im alten Textfeld
 * stand — „Was man wissen muss, um das zu tun."
 *
 * ---
 *
 * SONE — placeholders on empty blocks.
 *
 * An empty heading looks exactly like an empty paragraph, which made choosing a
 * block type feel as though nothing had happened: the type was applied to a new
 * empty block and there was no way to tell which line it was. The reported
 * symptom was having to hunt for the line that had become a heading.
 *
 * So the empty block holding the caret says what it is. Only that one: a
 * placeholder on every empty block turns a half-written page into a wall of grey
 * hints, which is the mistake this kind of feature usually makes.
 *
 * Implemented as a decoration carrying the text in an attribute, with CSS
 * drawing it through `content: attr(...)`. A widget would put a real element in
 * the flow, which the caret can end up behind and a copy can pick up.
