/**
 * SONE — keymap.
 *
 * The keys that decide whether a block editor feels right. Four of them do most
 * of the work and each has a non-obvious correct behaviour:
 *
 *   Enter        splits the block, and a *second* Enter in an empty list item
 *                lifts it out rather than creating another empty item. Without
 *                that, leaving a list means reaching for the mouse.
 *   Tab          indents by nesting inside the previous sibling. Only valid
 *                when there *is* a previous sibling of a container type —
 *                indenting the first item of a list has no meaning.
 *   Shift-Tab    outdents by lifting into the grandparent.
 *   Backspace    at the start of a block converts it to a paragraph before
 *                merging, so backspacing out of a heading gives plain text
 *                rather than swallowing the previous block.
