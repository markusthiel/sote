/**
 * SONE — lighting the block somebody was taken to (ADR-0167).
 *
 * ADR-0166 wrote `data-found` straight onto the block's DOM element from the
 * right sidebar. It was reported not working the day it was released, and
 * measuring said why: **ProseMirror owns that element.** Its DOM observer sees
 * the attribute appear, treats it as a change to reconcile, and puts the
 * element back the way the document says — within a tick, which is far too
 * short for anybody to see.
 *
 * A decoration is the one way to put something on a rendered node and have it
 * stay: ProseMirror draws it, so ProseMirror keeps it, and it is mapped through
 * every transaction while it is on.
 *
 * ## It holds an id, not a position
 *
 * The panel that asks knows a block id and nothing else. A position would have
 * to be resolved at the moment of asking and mapped afterwards; the id is what
 * survives an edit anywhere else in the document, including one that moves this
 * block.
 *
 * The cost is a scan of the top level per redraw **while something is lit**,
 * which is a second and a half at a time and nothing at all the rest of the
 * time.
