/**
 * SONE — editor construction.
 *
 * Binds a ProseMirror editor to a page's Y.XmlFragment through y-prosemirror.
 * One editor per page, one fragment per page (ADR-0015), which is what makes
 * selection across blocks, a single undo stack and drag between blocks work at
 * all.
 *
 * The undo plugin is y-prosemirror's, not prosemirror-history's: in a
 * collaborative document, undo must revert *this user's* last change rather
 * than the document's, and prosemirror-history has no notion of authorship.
 * Using the wrong one means undo occasionally reverts a colleague's edit, which
 * is the kind of bug that destroys trust in an editor.

 * The label drawn beside somebody else's caret.

 * `displayName` from the argument, which is never there, so every caret said
 * "Someone" in the library's fallback orange. @sone/client now publishes a
 * `user` copy alongside its own fields, and this reads what it is actually
 * given.
 *
 * Kept rather than falling back to y-prosemirror's default builder for three
 * reasons: the fallbacks below are ours to choose, the name is inserted as text
 * with an explicit guarantee — it is another person's input arriving over the
 * wire — and the label carries a class the stylesheet can fade.
 *
 * ## Why the label fades
 *
 * A name beside a caret says "somebody is working here". Left on screen it says
 * that long after they have stopped, and in a document with two or three people
 * the labels become part of the furniture — sitting in the middle of a
 * paragraph, obscuring the text they are meant to annotate.
 *
 * The fade is a CSS animation rather than a timer. y-prosemirror rebuilds the
 * decoration whenever awareness changes, so a moving caret produces a new
 * element and restarts the animation; a caret that has not moved keeps the same
 * element, and the animation runs to its end. Movement resets it for free, with
 * nothing to clear up and no timer to leak.
 *
 * Exported so it can be tested on its own: y-prosemirror keeps its options in a
 * closure, so reaching this through the plugin is not possible.
