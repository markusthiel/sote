/**
 * SONE — numbered list numbering.
 *
 * Numbers are computed and attached as decorations rather than drawn by CSS.
 *
 * CSS counters cannot do this. Blocks are flat siblings carrying an indent
 * attribute (ADR-0018), so there is no element to hang a `counter-reset` on
 * when a nested run begins or ends — a counter would either run continuously
 * through nested items, or reset on every item. Both are visibly wrong, and no
 * selector expresses "reset when the previous sibling had a smaller indent".
 *
 * So the rules are applied here, where the document structure is actually
 * available:
 *
 *   - a run of numbered items at the same indent numbers 1, 2, 3…
 *   - a deeper run starts again at 1
 *   - returning to a shallower level continues where that level left off
 *   - any non-numbered block at a given indent ends the run at that indent and
 *     everything deeper
 *
 * The last rule is the one people notice: a paragraph between two numbered
 * items restarts the numbering, which is what every word processor does.
