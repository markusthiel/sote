/**
 * The block attributes a table cannot write itself.
 *
 * Enabling `columnResizing` installs prosemirror-tables' own node view, which
 * builds `<div class="tableWrapper"><table>…` in JavaScript and never consults
 * the schema's `toDOM`. So every attribute this project puts on a block —
 * `data-block`, `data-width`, `data-align`, `data-color` — is absent from a
 * table's rendered DOM. The stylesheet says so at length, having lost a release
 * to it, and lived with matching `.ProseMirror table` instead.
 *
 * That workaround covers the styling that is the same for every table. It cannot
 * cover the *per-block* settings, which is why "Column / Wide / Full page" did
 * nothing to a table: the width is in the document and never reaches the page.
 *
 * A node decoration is the way to add attributes to a node whose DOM somebody
 * else builds — it applies to the node view's outer element, which is the
 * wrapper. So the values are read from the node and put back on, and the width
 * rules that work for every other block work here too.
